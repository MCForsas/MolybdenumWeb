# Rhenium

A website with the mission of connecting people who want to work at more flexible times and people who need a specialist ASAP.

## Getting Started

This repo is a raw php file directory. It is being built with VSCode, but you can use whatever editor or IDE to work. There are some requirements to using it. See *requirements*

## Requirements

You must have a MYSQL DB on your local host. 
//TODO: Add instructions for managing database.

### About the website

It's never a good situation when you need some help from a specialist, but there are none working. Meanwhile if you are a professional at something and you have a day off or maybe you can't work on some date, how could you inform your clients? Well with this app it's easy. Create a schedule for your business, add times for meetings outside your working hours and so on and so on.
Have a specialist at your door at any time, find the best times for you and get notified when your meeting gets shifted.

### Some remarks
